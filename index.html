      Note to myself here, I was having trouble connecting git kraken GUI but I
      think it's working now, commits should be showing up in both kraken and
      git bash, and they are, just checked with git log, we're good to go

    <h1><u> How the internet works </u></h1>
    <h2>
      What is it? "A global network of networks" (it's just a bunch of connected
      computers)
    </h2>
    <h2>
      The internet uses what's called 'routing', where there are other machines
      that have the job of connecting users together, and the way individual
      machines are identified are through IP addresses(internet-protocol), there
      are even undersea cables that go all over the globe, inside protective
      casings deep in the pacific, atlantic, indian, even around the horn of
      Africa
    </h2>
    <h2>
      To summarize the internet is a global network of networks, it's the
      infrastructure that makes everything from email, file sharing, online
      gaming, streaming services, and the web as a whole possible
    </h2>
    <h1>
      <u> Intro to the web </u>
    </h1>
    <h2>
      The world wide web is an information system where documents and resources
      are available over the internet.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Documents are transferred using HTTP (HYPER-TEXT-TRANSFER-PROTOCOL) The
      resources are identified by URL (Uniform resource locator)
    </h2>
    <h1>HTTP REQUESTS</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Foundation of the web</li>
      <li>
        Request -> I would like this info please, Response -> Ok, here you go!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      So http is a set of rules, a protocol on how the form of communication
      should work, there are other protocols on the internet, there's the TCPIP
      protocol, and many others
    </h2>
    <h2>
      There are servers dedicated entirely to the web, they deal with requests
      all day long, "server" also refers to the software running on the computer
    </h2>
    <h2>
      For example if you go to reddit.com and input a subreddit that doesn't
      exist, it's the servers job to say "I don't know what that is", then sends
      back an error or a different page displaying that the subreddit does not
      exist
    </h2>

    <h2>
      A very common term is client-side, which basically means the user-side or
      what you see when you go to yahoo.com or google or whatever website,
      you're on the client side, the client is the browser
    </h2>

    <h2>
      And all the stuff that happens on yahoos, or googles side happens on the
      server or server-side
    </h2>

    <h1>CLIENT</h1>
    <h2>The computer that accesses a server</h2>
    <h1>The request/response cycle</h1>
    <h2>So what happens when the server responds, what happens?</h2>
    <h2>
      Well our web browser chrome, firefox, safari is sending an http request,
      it finds it's way eventually to yahoos, googles, or reddits servers, the
      servers then respond with a web page, but there's a lot more detail than
      just that
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Reddits servers don't auto-respond with the webpage, it responds with
      instructions, or the server response with instructions of code that my
      browser understands and then can display. The job of the browser is to
      render content/code for me to view on the screen.
    </h2>

    <h2>
      Let's take google for example, if we type 'chickens' into youtube's search
      bar, we are sending an HTTP request, which eventually makes it's way to
      googles servers, then that server now has the task of figuring out what
      I'm asking for based on the request, and in the case of google, takes a
      lot of work. But it then builds a webpage, then it responds back with
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, translates and displays our chickens search for
      us with images, ads, content etc.
      <h1>FRONT-END VS. BACK-END</h1>

      <h2>
        So two terms we'll see a lot of are front-end and back-end, so when we
        make that HTTP request, there's code that has to run on that server to
        make it work.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        An example would be like a restaurant, the front end is the menu, and
        the back-end is the chef who assembles the correct ingredients for the
        meal you request
      </h2>
      <h2>
        So just remember, the front and back end are connected, the front end
        uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the back-end uses other languages
        like Python, C, Java. Lot's of languages could be running the backend.
      </h2>

      <h2>
        In this course we'll be doing both, so you'll get a taste of how the web
        works, both on the front-end, and the back-end
      </h2>

      <h1>What does HTML, CSS, and JavaScript do?</h1>

      <h2>
        The HTML describes the 'what', the things on the page, the text content
        and the paragraphs.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        CSS is the colors and styling of the page, so our webpage doesn't look
        like it was made in the early 90's with just text content and zero
        styling
      </h2>
      <h2>JavaScript, the functionality, the action of the webpage</h2>

      <h1>HTML: The essentials</h1>
      <h2>
        Crucial:
        <ul>
          <li>Paragraph elements</li>
          <li>HTML Headings</li>
          <li>HTML Lists</li>
          <li>HTML Anchor tags</li>
          <li>HTML Images</li>
          <li>HTML Boilerplate</li>
        </ul>
      </h2>
      <h2>
        Important:
        <ul>
          <li>Using MDN (Mozilla Developer Network)</li>
          <li>Important</li>
        </ul>
      </h2>
      <h2>
        Nice to have:
        <ul>
          <li>VSCode formatting on save</li>
        </ul>
